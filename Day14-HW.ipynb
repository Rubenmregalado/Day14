    "I believe the use of algorithms to make decisions can be very useful but there should be more restrictions to what decisions they can make. For instance, algorithms can be really useful for executing simple tasks such as accounting work and maybe editing events due to weather events but I think these algorithms need to be regulated when they can affect peoples lives. If these algorithms are trusted with important decisions such as employment evaluations and loan applications, they should have a wide consirderation pool and shouldnt be independently decisive on these topics with observational data. I believe these algoriths need to be checked and regulated by an individual or group of employees. "

    "I think the \"right decisions\" is subjective based on each persons morals but I think it is important to focus more on the facts of the data rather than my opinions on it. For instance I think if were analyzing data about miniorities or a hot topic in the world, I think it is best to focus on the data and make a statement that is as close to the trends the data show. I feel it is best to put all opinions to the side while analyzing data sets so we could make the best observations based on the data."

    "**Reading Report**\n",
    "For this ethics exploration I read the book Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Niel, which was originally published in 2016. In this book, the author speaks about her time as a data anylist and data scientist and how the use of mass data algorithms have largely negativley influences various aspects of our society. O'Niel speaks of how there is a larger need for transparency and accountability in these data models, drawing many examples from her own life and other peoples lives who have been affected by these fully autonomous data models. In the books she defines these models as 'weapons of math destruction' and further defines the detrimental affects of these models. \n",
    "    Although these models are based on historical  data, they have no parameters from how the computer should interpret the data which makes the outcomes available  with no reasoning from the computer. For instance she uses an example about standardized testing in schools where teachers are evaluated based on their students test scores and this aspect of their evaluation trumps other aspects of their report without an audit from a human. This shows how the use of these algorithms can negetivley affect people lives without giving reasoning for the computers aactions. \n",
    "    Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book and learning about the factors in Mass data and alorithms. I really think its a must read for student who would like to enter the data field and I believe the points it makes is really helpful in an ethical deliema such as this one."
